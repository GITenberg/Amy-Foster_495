description: In the nineteenth century, mass immigration changed the face of the world.
  Although we like to think of this cross-cultural pollination as being a positive
  trend in human history, the truth of the matter is not always clear. In "Amy Foster,"
  prose master Joseph Conrad takes on the dark side of immigration and the intermingling
  of vastly different cultures and worldviews.
